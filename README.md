# Project description

I have built Frontend app by using React that uses my first created API that is built using Node.js and Express.
The app shows Netflix movies and their details.

It was a great learning experience having built both the Backend and Frontend of a project for the first time.

## The problem

The app shows the whole list of all the movies in the database. Since there are over 1000 movies I am whowing first 10 movies when the page is loaded and I implemented 'Load more' button which is widly used in e-commerce websites to load new items on a website. I find this feature very useful and user friendly.

## View it live
